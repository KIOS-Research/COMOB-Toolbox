matlab-contam-toolbox
=====================

The Matlab-CONTAM Toolbox is an open-source software which operates within the Matlab environment, for providing a programming interface for CONTAM (http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/IAQanalysis/CONTAM/), a multizone airflow and contaminant transport analysis software with Matlab, a  high-level technical computing software. The goal of the Toolbox is to serve as a common programming framework for research, which facilitates simulating multiple contamination events under varying conditions as well as to store computed data in data structures so that they can be reused by different algorithms.
